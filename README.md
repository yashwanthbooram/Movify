# Movify 
## A place to find and journal your next favorite film.

Movify is a modern, full-stack web application built with the MERN stack, designed to be a personal movie journal and discovery platform. Inspired by services like Letterboxd, it allows users to search for movies, add them to a personal journal, write reviews, and get personalized recommendations.
